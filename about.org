My name is Roi Martin.  I am a programmer and a security enthusiast
that has been lucky enough to make a living out of combining both
passions.

Time has shown me that blogs do not work for me.  Their chronological
nature and having to wait until you finish a blog post to publish it
does not fit my personality.  I like to approach problems in an
iterative way and tend to jump from one project to another.  Which,
*for me*, is incompatible with writing a blog.

Also, I like to take notes while learning new things, so I thought
that publishing these notes could be useful for others and fits me
better.  This site contains my always-work-in-progress notes.

You can find me in [[https://github.com/jroimartin][GitHub]], where I publish most of my projects, and
[[https://fosstodon.org/@jroimartin][Mastodon]].
