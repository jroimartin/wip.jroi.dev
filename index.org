In this site I publish the notes I take as part of my learning
process.  I usually jump from one project to another and eventually
come back to a previous one, so all the notes here are
work-in-progress and can change.  If you want to follow my work, you
can subscribe to this [[https://github.com/jroimartin/wip.jroi.dev/commits/main.atom][RSS feed]] or watch my [[https://github.com/jroimartin/wip.jroi.dev][jroimartin/wip.jroi.dev]]
